## ✨ Why this package

[`padosoft/laravel-flow`](https://github.com/padosoft/laravel-flow) is intentionally **headless** — a deterministic, queue-driven workflow engine you can drop into any Laravel app.

**`laravel-flow-admin` is the operator console for it.** A production-style control plane for runs, approvals, outbox webhooks and configuration — without leaking the engine's internal namespaces into your app.

> Think **Horizon** for queues, **Pulse** for metrics — and **Flow Admin** for the lifecycle of long-running, multi-step business workflows.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 📊 **Overview dashboard** — KPI tiles, sparklines, recent runs, queue health, error rate.
- 🏃 **Runs index & detail** — filterable list, full timeline (timeline / Gantt / DAG), payload diff, retry/cancel actions.
- ✅ **Approvals inbox** — pending decisions with one-click approve / reject through your own authorizer.
- 📤 **Webhook outbox** — delivery state, replay failed jobs, inspect headers/payloads.
- 📋 **Flow definitions** — registered workflows, version, last activity at a glance.
- 🧩 **Flow Studio canvas** — React + `@xyflow/react` visual graph: read-only view of a flow's published version, plus a full drag-and-drop editor (palette from the node catalog, typed-connection validation, node inspector, save-as-draft) gated by your `ActionAuthorizer`.
- 🗂️ **Flow versioning** — every stored version listed with its draft/published/archived status, one-click **Publish** behind an immutability confirmation (core re-validates on publish), and a node-level **visual diff** between any two versions (added glows green, removed red-dashed, changed amber) computed server-side so no node `config` ever leaves the server.
- 📡 **Live run monitor** — a per-run page that subscribes to core's private broadcast channel (`node.transitioned` / `run.progress`) via Laravel Echo when broadcasting is enabled, or **falls back to polling** when it isn't. Renders all nine real `NodeState` colors plus a separate ⚡ cache-hit badge on succeeded nodes, with a live progress header. The polled state endpoint carries node states only — never the run's payloads.
- 🧪 **Dry-run planner** — a **Dry run** button on the Studio editor statically plans the current graph via core's `DryRunPlanner` (Kahn-wave execution order + a per-node/total cost estimate) and renders the wave plan + cost, executing **no** handler and writing **zero** rows.
- 🤖 **Build with AI** — a **Build with AI** panel on the Studio editor turns a natural-language prompt into an **already-validated** draft graph via [`padosoft/laravel-flow-ai`](https://github.com/padosoft/laravel-flow-ai)'s `FlowBuilderService` (the model picks only from your real node catalog; the result runs through core's `GraphValidator` server-side before it ever reaches the browser). The graph is loaded onto the canvas for you to review and edit — **nothing is persisted** until you click *Save as draft*. Gated by `ActionAuthorizer::canEditDefinition()`; optional (only shown when the AI package is installed).
- ⚡ **⌘K command palette** — jump anywhere in two keystrokes.
- 🎨 **Pixel-perfect dark + light themes** — persisted in cookie, switchable per user.
- 🛡️ **Deny-by-default authorizer** — every mutation goes through your `ActionAuthorizer`. No accidents.
- 🔁 **Auto-refreshing pages** — configurable polling (`/flow/api/live`).
- 🧱 **Adapter pattern** — `eloquent` for prod, `array` for demos / E2E (deterministic seed-42 fixtures).
- 🧪 **Battle-tested** — 175 PHPUnit tests, 26 Playwright scenarios (78 runs across Chromium / Firefox / WebKit — 72 pass, 6 skipped: 3 visual-gated + 1 WebKit drag-and-drop limitation + 2 cross-browser click/drag limitations on one node-deletion scenario).
- 📦 **Zero-coupling** — built on a public `Contracts\*` surface; engine internals stay `@internal`.

## 📦 Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| PHP | `^8.3` (also tested on 8.4) |
| Laravel | `^13.0` |
| [`padosoft/laravel-flow`](https://github.com/padosoft/laravel-flow) | `dev-main` (development-time — see note below) |
| Node.js (only if you want to rebuild assets) | `>=20` |
| Database | any Laravel-supported driver (or `array` adapter for demos) |

> 💡 You **do not** need Node.js to use this package. Pre-built assets ship inside the package and are publishable via `vendor:publish`.

> 🚧 **Development-time note**: this repo is mid-flight on the **Laravel Flow 2.0 program** (Macro E, Flow Studio UI). `padosoft/laravel-flow` has no v2 tagged release yet, so `composer.json` resolves it via a local `path` repository pointing at `../padosoft-laravel-flow` (a sibling checkout one directory up). That means `padosoft/laravel-flow-admin` is not `composer require`-able outside a monorepo-adjacent dev setup until core tags v2.0.0 — at which point this switches back to a normal SemVer range.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install both packages
composer require padosoft/laravel-flow-admin

# 2. Publish config + assets
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-assets

# 3. Run flow-engine migrations (from padosoft/laravel-flow)
php artisan migrate

# 4. Visit the admin panel
php artisan serve
# 👉  http://localhost:8000/flow
```

That's it. The panel is **read-only by default** (deny-all authorizer) so you can safely browse production data on day 1, then opt-in to mutations when you've wired your permission rules.

---

## 📖 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install the underlying engine

`laravel-flow-admin` is a UI on top of `padosoft/laravel-flow`. If you don't already have it, install it first:

```bash
composer require padosoft/laravel-flow
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

This creates the `flow_runs`, `flow_run_nodes`, `flow_approvals`, `flow_webhook_outbox`, `flow_definitions` and related tables that this admin panel reads from.

> 📖 Full engine docs: [github.com/padosoft/laravel-flow](https://github.com/padosoft/laravel-flow)

### 2. Install the admin panel

```bash
composer require padosoft/laravel-flow-admin
```

The service provider is auto-discovered. Routes, views, config and migrations are loaded out-of-the-box from the package.

### 3. Publish assets and config

```bash
# Publish the config (config/flow-admin.php) — recommended
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-config

# Publish compiled CSS/JS to public/vendor/flow-admin (required for styling)
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-assets

# Optional: publish Blade views to resources/views/vendor/flow-admin (for customization)
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-views
```

> ⚠️ **Don't skip `flow-admin-assets`** in production. The panel relies on the published CSS/JS bundle.

### 4. Configure middleware & routes

By default the panel mounts at `/flow` and runs through `web,auth` middleware. Override with environment variables:

```env
FLOW_ADMIN_PREFIX=ops/flow
FLOW_ADMIN_MIDDLEWARE="web,auth,verified,can:access-flow-admin"
FLOW_ADMIN_THEME=dark
FLOW_ADMIN_STEP_VIZ=timeline
FLOW_ADMIN_POLLING_MS=4000
```

> 🛡️ If you set `FLOW_ADMIN_MIDDLEWARE=""` we **fall back to `['web']`** instead of leaving the panel unauthenticated. Setting it empty was a known footgun, so we close it explicitly.

### 5. Wire your authorizer

The panel ships with `DenyAllAuthorizer` so every mutation (resume, reject, replay, cancel, retry-webhook) is **blocked by default**. To enable mutations, implement your own:

```php
// app/Flow/AdminAuthorizer.php
namespace App\Flow;

use Padosoft\LaravelFlowAdmin\Contracts\ActionAuthorizer;

final class AdminAuthorizer implements ActionAuthorizer
{
    public function canResume(string $runId): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()?->can('flow.runs.resume') ?? false;
    }

    public function canCancel(string $runId): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()?->can('flow.runs.cancel') ?? false;
    }

    public function canApprove(string $approvalId): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()?->can('flow.approvals.act') ?? false;
    }

    public function canReject(string $approvalId): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()?->can('flow.approvals.act') ?? false;
    }

    public function canReplayWebhook(string $outboxId): bool
    {
        return auth()->user()?->can('flow.outbox.replay') ?? false;
    }
}
```

Bind it in `AppServiceProvider::register()`:

```php
use Padosoft\LaravelFlowAdmin\Contracts\ActionAuthorizer;
use App\Flow\AdminAuthorizer;

$this->app->bind(ActionAuthorizer::class, AdminAuthorizer::class);
```

…or set `'authorizer' => App\Flow\AdminAuthorizer::class` in `config/flow-admin.php`.

### 6. Visit the panel

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/flow> and you should see the dashboard. Press **`⌘K`** (or `Ctrl+K`) anywhere to open the command palette.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All keys live in `config/flow-admin.php`. They are also overridable via environment variables.

| Key | Env | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prefix` | `FLOW_ADMIN_PREFIX` | `flow` | URI prefix for all routes (`/flow`, `/flow/runs`, …). |
| `middleware` | `FLOW_ADMIN_MIDDLEWARE` | `web,auth` | Comma-separated middleware stack. Empty/whitespace falls back to `['web']`. |
| `adapter` | `FLOW_ADMIN_ADAPTER` | `eloquent` | `eloquent` (prod) or `array` (deterministic demo fixtures). |
| `authorizer` | — | `DenyAllAuthorizer` | FQCN of your `ActionAuthorizer` implementation. |
| `polling_interval_ms` | `FLOW_ADMIN_POLLING_MS` | `4000` | Auto-refresh interval for live pages. |
| `theme_default` | `FLOW_ADMIN_THEME` | `dark` | `dark` or `light`. Per-user override stored in `flow_admin_theme` cookie. |
| `step_viz_default` | `FLOW_ADMIN_STEP_VIZ` | `timeline` | Default visualization on run detail: `timeline`, `gantt`, or `dag`. |

---

## 🔒 Authorization (mutations)

Every mutation route (resume, reject, replay, cancel, retry-webhook, Studio's edit-graph load, draft save and publish) consults your `ActionAuthorizer` **before** the controller runs. This is non-negotiable: there is no "global admin" bypass and no way to short-circuit the gate from a Blade view.

`ActionAuthorizer::canEditDefinition()` gates the Studio authoring routes: loading a flow's UNREDACTED graph (`GET /studio/{name}/edit-graph`, node `config` included — unlike the read-only canvas's `graph()` endpoint, which redacts it), saving an edited graph as a new draft (`POST /studio/{name}/draft`), publishing a draft version (`POST /studio/{name}/publish`), and generating a draft graph from a natural-language prompt (`POST /studio/{name}/ai-build` — it reveals graph structure and spends a billable model call, so it sits behind the same authoring gate; it never persists, the operator saves the reviewed result through `/draft`). The default `DenyAllAuthorizer` denies them all; ship your own `ActionAuthorizer` (or set `FLOW_ADMIN_AUTHORIZER=allow` for local dev/E2E — see `AllowAllAuthorizer`, dev-only, never production) to enable Studio editing. The version-list and diff read endpoints (`GET /studio/{name}/version-list`, `GET /studio/{name}/diff`) carry no node `config` and so sit at the same visibility level as the read-only `graph()` endpoint.

`GET /studio/catalog` (the editor palette's node-type catalog) is deliberately **not** gated by `canEditDefinition()` — it returns node-type metadata only (names, categories, port shapes), never a flow's `config`, so it's reachable by any request that clears the base `flow-admin.middleware` stack (typically `web,auth`). If your node-type names/descriptions are themselves sensitive, gate this route yourself (e.g. wrap it in additional middleware) before exposing Studio.

**Live monitor broadcasting** — the live run monitor subscribes to core's **private** per-run channel (`{prefix}.run.{runId}`). `padosoft/laravel-flow` emits only and ships **no** channel-authorization callback, so you must authorize the channel in your app's `routes/channels.php` (e.g. `Broadcast::channel('laravel-flow.run.{runId}', fn ($user, $runId) => /* your rule */)`) and enable broadcasting (`LARAVEL_FLOW_BROADCASTING_ENABLED=true`) plus a working Echo client. If the channel isn't authorized (or broadcasting/Echo isn't wired), the monitor **falls back to polling** `GET /runs/{id}/monitor-state` — which returns node lifecycle state and progress only, never the run's payloads.

Public extension surface (semver-stable from `v0.1.0` →):

- `Padosoft\LaravelFlowAdmin\Contracts\ActionAuthorizer`
- `Padosoft\LaravelFlowAdmin\Contracts\ReadModel`
- `config/flow-admin.php` keys
- Publish tags: `flow-admin-config`, `flow-admin-views`, `flow-admin-assets`
- Route names: `flow-admin.*`

Everything under `Adapters\`, `Http\Controllers\`, `Support\`, `ViewModels\` is **internal** and may change between minor versions until v1.0.

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Override Blade views

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-admin-views
```

Edit anything under `resources/views/vendor/flow-admin/`. Component slots and named layout sections are preserved across upgrades.

### Override CSS tokens

The published bundle exposes CSS custom properties for colors, radii, spacing and font sizing. Wrap the panel in a custom theme by overriding tokens:

```css
:root[data-flow-admin-theme="dark"] {
  --flow-admin-color-accent: #6366f1;
  --flow-admin-color-bg: #0b0d12;
}
```

### Switch theme programmatically

```http
POST /flow/theme
X-CSRF-TOKEN: …
theme=dark|light
```

---

## 🧪 Demo Mode (no DB needed)

For showcases, screenshots, or end-to-end tests you can bypass the database entirely:

```env
FLOW_ADMIN_ADAPTER=array
```

The `ArrayReadModelAdapter` produces deterministic fixtures (`seed=42`) so KPI numbers, run IDs and timelines are reproducible across screenshots and Playwright runs. In this mode, the package also registers 4 real node handler classes (`demo.trigger`/`demo.validate`/`demo.charge`/`demo.notify`) matching the fixture graph's node types, so the Studio editor's save-as-draft flow validates and persists successfully against the demo fixture — a production Eloquent deployment's node catalog stays free of this demo-only noise.

---

## 🗺️ Routes

All routes live under the configured prefix (default `/flow`) and the `flow-admin.*` route-name namespace.

| Method | URI | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | `flow-admin.overview` | Dashboard |
| `GET` | `/studio` | `flow-admin.studio` | Flow Studio — flow definitions list, links into each one's canvas |
| `GET` | `/studio/{name}` | `flow-admin.studio.show` | Read-only graph canvas (React + `@xyflow/react`) for a flow's latest published version |
| `GET` | `/studio/{name}/graph` | `flow-admin.studio.graph` | JSON API backing the read-only canvas: `{graph, catalog}` (node `config` redacted), or 404 when nothing is published yet |
| `GET` | `/studio/catalog` | `flow-admin.studio.catalog` | JSON API: the full node-type catalog for the editor's palette (not scoped to a single flow) |

| `GET` | `/studio/{name}/edit-graph` | `flow-admin.studio.edit-graph` | JSON API backing the editor: `{graph, catalog, version, status}` with node `config` INCLUDED (unredacted) — gated by `ActionAuthorizer::canEditDefinition()`, deny-by-default |
| `POST` | `/studio/{name}/draft` | `flow-admin.studio.draft` | Saves the edited graph as a new draft version; server re-validates structurally and semantically (`GraphValidator`) before persisting — gated by `ActionAuthorizer::canEditDefinition()` |

## 🏛️ Architecture

```
HTTP request
   │
   ├─► routes/flow-admin.php  (prefix + middleware + name)
   │
   ├─► Http/Controllers/*Controller   ◄── thin: request → DTO → factory → view
   │       │
   │       ├─► Http/Requests/*Request   (validation, sorting, filtering DTOs)
   │       ├─► ViewModels/*Factory      (read-side view assembly)
   │       └─► Contracts/ActionAuthorizer (gate for any mutation)
   │
   ├─► Adapters/Eloquent | Array       (ReadModel implementations)
   │       └─► reads flow_* tables (via core's Dashboard\FlowDashboardReadModel) OR seed-42 fixtures
   │
   └─► resources/views/* + Alpine stores + Vite bundle (Blade/Alpine pages) or a React island (Studio)
```

The Blade/Alpine pages (Overview, Runs, Approvals, Outbox, Definitions, Settings) are server-rendered with a small inline-script layer. Flow Studio (`/studio`) is a React island instead: `resources/js/studio.jsx` builds via Vite (`@vitejs/plugin-react` + `@xyflow/react`) into a hashed bundle, mounted at `#flow-studio-root`. The built JS/CSS are served through package-internal routes (`_flow-admin/assets/studio.js` / `.css`) that resolve the current filename via `.vite/manifest.json`, rather than a `<script>` tag pointing at `public_path()` directly — Testbench's dev server can't expose this package's own `public/vendor/flow-admin/` build output through ITS public dir, so a manifest-resolving controller (mirroring the existing CSS asset route) is the only path that works identically in local dev, Playwright E2E, and a real consumer app.

Design source-of-truth for the existing runs/approvals/outbox panel lives under `.design-source/project/` (pixel reference) and is enforced through Playwright visual regression on chromium / firefox / webkit. The Flow Studio UI (graph canvas, editor, live run monitor — Macro E, in progress) is being built against a separate template under `design/claude-design-template/`.

> ℹ️ **Search & list scope**: the `eloquent` adapter reads through core's `Dashboard\FlowDashboardReadModel`, which only exposes single-field, exact-match filters (no free-text search, no distinct-name listing, no flow-name prefix match). Plain listing and single-status filtering use real server-side pagination and are **not** bounded — they reflect full history at any install size. Only a **free-text search** (or, on the runs list specifically, the compound `failed` status filter or a flow-name prefix filter) falls back to scanning the **200 most recent runs** rather than full history, since those queries can't be expressed as a single exact-match filter — the same bound `Dashboard\Pagination::MAX_PER_PAGE` already imposes on a single page. The definitions list shares this same 200-most-recent-runs bound (it derives flow names from recent run history). Installs with more than 200 runs since the oldest search match won't surface it; use direct DB access or a future `flow:*` Artisan command for full-history search. **KPIs and throughput buckets are not subject to this bound at all** — they page through every run in their rolling window (24h / 48h; logged, never silently truncated).

## ✅ Quality Gates

Every push runs through this gate (matrix `php: 8.3, 8.4` × `laravel: 13`):

```bash
composer validate --strict --no-check-publish
composer format:test          # Laravel Pint
composer analyse              # PHPStan / Larastan level 8
composer test                 # PHPUnit — 175 tests, 918 assertions
